# 6_MIT_Recommendation_Systems
## Project
Build a recommendation system to recommend the best Amazon products to users.

### Skills and Tools
Recommendation Systems

### Context
E-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart uses different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.

### Problem Statement
Work with an Amazon product reviews dataset to build a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products.  The dataset does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model

### Results
All exploratory and inferential statistical analysis, visualization and recommendation systems are included in the following project notebook:  [Jupyter Notebook](Amazon_Recommendation_System_Learner%27s_Notebook.ipynb)
